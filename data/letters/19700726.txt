this is the zodiac speaking

being that you will not wear some nice zodiac killer symbol.svg buttons, how about wearing some nasty zodiac-logo.jpg buttons. or any type of zodiac-logo.jpg buttons that you can think up. if you do not wear any type of zodiac-logo.jpg buttons, i shall (on top of everything else) torture all 13 of my slaves that i have wateing for me in paradice. some i shall tie over ant hills and watch them scream & twich and sqwirm. others shall have pine splinters driven under their nails & then burned. others shall be placed in cages & fed salt beef untill they are gorged then i shall listen to their pleass for water and i shall laugh at them. others will hang by their thumbs & burn in the sun then i will rub them down with deep heat to warm them up. others i shall skin them alive & let them run around screaming. and all billiard players i shall have them play in a darkened dungen cell with crooked cues & twisted shoes. yes i shall have great fun inflicting the most delicious of pain to my slaves
