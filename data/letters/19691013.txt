this is the zodiac speaking.

i am the murderer of the taxi driver over by washington st & maple st last night, to prove this here is a blood stained piece of his shirt. i am the same man who did in the people in the north bay area.

the s.f. police could have caught me last night if they had searched the park properly instead of holding road races with their motorcicles seeing who could make the most noise. the car drivers should have just parked their cars and sat there quietly waiting for me to come out of cover.

school children make nice targets, i think i shall wipe out a school bus some morning. just shoot out the front tire & then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out.
