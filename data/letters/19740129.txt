i saw and think "the exorcist" was the best saterical comidy that i have ever seen.

signed, yours truley:

he plunged himself into the billowy wave 
and an echo arose from the suicide's grave 
titwillo titwillo titwillo

ps. ‚Å†if i do not see this note in your paper, i will do something nasty, which you know i'm capable of doing.
