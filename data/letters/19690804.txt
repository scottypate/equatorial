dear editor

this is the zodiac speaking.

in answer to your asking for more details about the good times i have had in vallejo, i shall be very happy to supply even more material. by the way, are the police haveing a good time with the code? if not, tell them to cheer up; when they do crack it they will have me.

on the 4th of july:

i did not open the car door, the window was rolled down all ready. the boy was origionaly sitting in the front seat when i began fireing. when i fired the first shot at his head, he leaped backwards at the same time thus spoiling my aim. he ended up on the back seat then the floor in back thashing out very violently with his legs; thats how i shot him in the knee. i did not leave the cene of the killing with squealling tires & raceing engine as described in the vallejo paper,. i drove away quite slowly so as not to draw attention to my car.

the man who told the police that my car was brown was a negro about 40â€“45 rather shabbly dressed. i was at this phone booth haveing some fun with the vallejo cops when he was walking by. when i hung the phone up the dam x@ thing began to ring & that drew his attention to me & my car.

in that epasode the police were wondering as to how i could shoot & hit my victoms in the dark. they did not openly state this, but implied this by saying it was a well lit night & i could see the silowets on the horizon. bull shit that area is srounded by high hills & trees. what i did was tape a small pencel flash light to the barrel of my gun. if you notice, in the center of the beam of light if you aim it at a wall or celling you will see a black or darck spot in the center of the circle of light about 3 to 6 inches across. when taped to a gun barrel, the bullet will strike exactly in the center of the black dot in the light. all i had to do was spray them as if it was a water hose; there was no need to use the gun sights. i was not happy to see that i did not get front page coverage.
