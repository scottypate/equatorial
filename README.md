### Equatorial: Genetic Search algorithm for solving Zodiac 340 cipher

The Zodiac 340 cipher is an unsolved cipher that was produced by the Zodiac killer. This attempt to solve the cipher is using random solutions with selection pressure applied through a fitness function. Previous work that has been done to apply genetic algorithms to this problem have used a fitness function that requires complete word matches. We know that the person that wrote the Zodiac ciphers was a poor speller. Our fitness evaluation function attempts to give partial credit for things such as bigrams, trigrams, letter frequency, and fuzzy word matches.
